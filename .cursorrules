im creating working in a job to build a company profile website, for a cunstruction service, im using inertia-vue-ts-laravel
for now im focusing on creating the front end first, so fill the data with just dummy data first and for the routing just using render only, use indonesia language
this is the style guide for my app :
1. Color Composition using tailwindcss
- Primary Colors:
    - Dark Blue : Conveys professionalism and reliability.
    - Deep Orange : Adds energy and reflects construction-related themes (e.g., machinery, bricks).
    - Steel Gray : Represents durability and construction materials.
- Secondary Colors:
    - Light Gray : Clean and modern background color.
    - Neutral Beige : Adds warmth and avoids sterile looks.
- Accent Colors:
    - Golden Yellow : Highlights key elements like CTAs.
    - Soft Green : Optional for eco-friendly or sustainability messages.
2. The Feel or theme i want :
    - mobile responsive
    - Strong,Elegant & Professional Feel
    - Smooth, deliberate animations that feel "weighted" and professional
    - High-contrast, clean typography
    - Modern Interaction Design
    - Scroll-Based Reveals: Elements gracefully appear as you scroll
    - Parallax Effects: Subtle depth through layered movement
    - Hover States: Refined, smooth transitions that feel intentional
    - Text Animations: Words and headlines that smoothly fade and slide in
    - Visual Hierarchy
    - Clear section transitions
    - Strong contrast between text and backgrounds
     ##Motion Design Principles
        - Timing: Slower, more deliberate animations (700ms-1500ms)
        - Easing: Smooth acceleration/deceleration (power4.out)
        - Staggering: Elements animate in sequence, not all at once
        - Depth: Using parallax and scale to create visual layers
3. always check for case sensitive when referencing, naming the component, vue file, and the tailwindcss class.
